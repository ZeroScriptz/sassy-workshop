# Sassy Workshop Website

## Workshop Project for SASS/SCSS project to grasp more of SASS/SCSS
### Thanks to Nicholas Hazel for the tip! 


## What I learned :

### Animating simple call to action button
### Making these mobile friendly, especially reusable syntax block for tablet/mobile usage.


## Challenges :

### Animation learning, animations were different with syntax though was easily learned after a few trial and errors

## Overall :
  ### This is simple CSS though with using SCSS/SASS it helps with media queries on the applicable markup items.
